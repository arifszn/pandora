Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD), also known as CI/CD, embodies a culture, operating principles, and a set of practices that application development teams use to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably.

Pandora uses **[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)** for validating and testing Pull Request.

Here's an overview of the used workflow so that any newcomer can be familiar with CI/CD.

# Workflow File

The workflow file is situated in the `.github/workflows/test.yml` file. Whenever a pull request is created, the workflow runs the pipeline to validate the pull request running Lint test, PHPUnit test. You can extend or modify it according to your need.

The test result can be viewed in the pull request or in the [`Actions`](https://github.com/arifszn/pandora/actions) tab.
